<h2 id="book-notes-by-jennifer-t">book notes by Jennifer T.</h2>
<p>I went through the book : Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. I think it is critical we have a good solid understanding of facts and methods from professionals. Below are my notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good sleeping habits involve night sleep consolidation, regular and long naps, and self soothing skills</li>
<li>After 12 weeks of age, a baby needs to nap at 9am and 1pm.</li>
<li>After 12 weeks of age, the daytime sleep regulates itself and naps develop.</li>
<li>After six weeks of age, sleep training can start but the bulk of the training occurs after four months.</li>
<li>Before 4 months of age, stay flexible and follow the baby''s flow of sleep.</li>
<li>After 12 weeks of age, baby must go to bed earlier around 6-7pm. If you want your baby to sleep longer, they need to go to bed earlier and have good quality naps.</li>
<li>After 4 months of age, sleeping outside the crib should be rare.</li>
<li>catnaps, motion sleep (car), light sleep (stroller), naps at wrong time, are defined as "poor quality sleep".</li>
<li>High quality sleep occurs in a motionless environment, ie crib.</li>
<li>Turn off swing when baby is asleep.</li>
<li>After 4 months of age, naps will develop over an hour and the night sleep up to 12 hours.</li>
<li>Never wake up a sleeping baby</li>
<li>Healthy sleep is being defined by the duration, naps, night consolidation, schedule, and regularity.</li>
<li>When moving bed time up, act by 20mn increments.</li>
<li>For naps it is important to watch for drowsiness signs (yawning, reduced activity, eyelids dropping) and use this window to take baby to crib. Don't miss your baby's window.</li>
<li>Naps need to be timed according to drowsiness, allow motionless sleep, and develop a consistency in soothing style.</li>
<li>There are two methods for soothing styles. The first one is to drop the child in the crib soothed, drowsy but awake. The second one is to wait for deep sleep. Either one is fine, but needs consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is of course more in the book, but it should get us started.</p>
<h2 id="notes-by-emma-a">notes by Emma A.</h2>
<p>Aside from the articles, here are some points that I learned after having two babies sleep trained:</p>
<ul>
<li>You definitely put the baby in the crib or wherever s/he sleeps on his/her back, BUT if they roll over on their stomach, leave them like that. Both of my babies started sleeping MUCH better when they started rolling over. I put them to bed on their back, but immediately they roll over and sleep the whole night on their stomach.</li>
<li>Many babies use a pacifier to self-sooth when they are in the light sleep. Don’t worry about weaning off the pacifier. My first one was as addicted to it as an alcoholic, but with a simple trick (again from babycenter) we weaned him off in one day!</li>
<li>Put them to bed early like 6-7. (I know everyone said it, I’m saying it again, it really makes a huge difference)</li>
<li>
<p>Gradually replace night feedings with water. (at the age of 6 months, a baby can stay full 6 hours at night, so you can feed him/her at 6pm, 12am and 6am, and in the middle if s/he wakes up for nursing, offer water.) Eventually they realize there’s no milk in the middle just for soothing, and they stay sleep till they get hungry. (I couldn’t believe this one, until I did it! It sounds harsh, I know, but you are actually doing him/her a favor by not making him/her “think” that s/he has to wake up and nurse to self-sooth.)</p>
</li>

<p>Babycenter.com articles were extremely helpful: Articles are short, all in bullet points with practical and touchable examples, very clear and instructive, and at the end you see other people’s comments which at least make you think you are not alone!  Here’s a sample article, but you can find many more: http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-training-the-basics_1505715.bc</p>
